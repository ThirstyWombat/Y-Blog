# Y-Blog

<a href="">Y-Blog</a>

## Concept

First, let's start with the navigation. The navigation should be located at the top of the UI and should include the following sections: Home, Profile, and Login. The Home section should be the default landing page when the user first enters the app. The Blog section should display all the blog posts in list with post, and author's name. The Login section should provide a form for users to enter their login credentials.

Next, let's move on to the blog post section. Each blog post should be displayed in a card format with the author name, date, and a brief excerpt of the post. Users should be able to click on the card to view the full blog post and its corresponding comments. At the bottom of each blog post, there should be a section for comments. Users should be able to leave comments on the blog post. The comments section should display the user's name, profile picture, and comment.

Moving on to the post creation section. When a user logs in, they should be directed to a dashboard where they can create a new blog post. The post creation form should include fields for the body. Once the user submits the form, the blog post should be added to the Blog section.

Overall, the UI should have a clean and modern design with a consistent color scheme and typography. The navigation should be easy to use and the blog post section should be visually appealing with clear and concise information. The post creation section should be user-friendly and intuitive.
